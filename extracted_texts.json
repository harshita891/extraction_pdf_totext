Subject to the section entitled “Government or Third Party” below, I hereby irrevocably and perpetually assign and agree to assign (on a worldwide, and royalty free basis) in the future (when any such Inventions or Intellectual Property Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to NVIDIA Corporation all of my right, title, and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Intellectual Property Rights with respect thereto) made, conceived, reduced to practice, or learned by me, either alone or with others, during the period of my internship with the Company, except for Excluded Inventions. “Excluded Inventions” are only those Inventions that meet all of the following criteria: Inventions that (a) I develop entirely on my own time (without using any Group Company equipment, supplies, facilities, Confidential Information or trade secret information), (b) do not result from any work performed by me for the Company or the Group Company, and (c) do not relate to Group Company’s business or any actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of Group Company (as determined and approved by a member of NVIDIA Corporation’s Legal Department and my manager (or business unit Vice President, if required by Group Company’s policies)).

Inventions assigned to NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company pursuant to this section or to a third party as directed by NVIDIA Corporation pursuant to the section below titled “Government or Third Party” or otherwise to any Group Company under applicable law are referred to in this Agreement as “NVIDIA Inventions.” Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19(4) and 30A of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, such assignment or license (as the case may be) in so far as it relates to copyrightable material shall not lapse nor the rights transferred therein revert to me, even if the Company does not exercise the rights under the assignment or license (as the case may be) within a period of one year from the date of assignment. I further acknowledge and agree that I shall waive any right to and shall not raise any objection or claims to the Copyright Board with respect to the assignment, pursuant to Section 19A of the Copyright Act, 1957. 2.4 Obligation to Keep NVIDIA Corporation Informed. In addition to my other obligations hereunder, during the period of my internship with the Company, I will promptly disclose to NVIDIA Corporation fully and in writing all patent applications filed by me or on my behalf. In order for NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether any invention was made during my internship with Company and/or is based upon Group Company’s Confidential Information, I agree that during the two (2) year period after the termination of my internship by Company for any reason, I will promptly: (i) notify NVIDIA Corporation that any one or more patent applications have been filed by me or on my behalf, either alone or with others; and (ii) provide NVIDIA Corporation with a list of the names of the coapplicants, if any, and a description of the subject matter of the patent application that is sufficiently detailed to reasonably allow NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether it relates to Group Company’s Confidential Information, its business, or its actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development. 2.5 Government or Third Party. I also agree that as directed by NVIDIA Corporation, I will assign all of my right, title, and interest in and to any particular NVIDIA Invention to a third party, including without limitation the United States. 2.6 Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights and Assistance. During the period of my internship and thereafter, I will assist NVIDIA Corporation in every proper way to obtain and enforce United States and foreign Intellectual Property Rights relating to NVIDIA Inventions in all countries.

I will return those records to Company at the termination of my internship whether voluntary, or with or without cause by Company, or immediately upon request by Company. 4. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES. I agree that: (a) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not engage in any employment, consulting, advisory, business or similar activity (collectively, the “Outside Activities”) without the written approval (the “Approval”) of my immediate supervisor and the Vice President, Corporate Affairs of NVIDIA Corporation, as required under NVIDIA’s Conflict of Interest Guidelines; and (b) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not compete with Group Company, nor assist any person or entity in competing with Group Company, in preparing to compete with Group Company or in hiring any employees or consultants of Group Company. I have disclosed on Exhibit B a complete list of all Outside Activities that I am seeking Approval to participate in during my internship with Company. If no Outside Activities are listed in Exhibit B, I warrant that there are no Outside Activities. Examples of Outside Activities include, but are not limited to: engaging in self-employment; providing consulting or advisory services to any other company or business (unless on behalf of Group Company); or acting as a board member or officer of any entity. 5. RETURN OF GROUP COMPANY PROPERTY. Immediately upon termination of my internship or upon Company’s request at any other time, I will deliver to Company all of Group Company’s property, equipment, credit cards, phone cards, computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, building cards, keys and documents (hard-copy or electronic copies), together with all copies thereof, and any other material containing or disclosing any Inventions, Third Party Information or Confidential Information of Group Company and certify in writing that I have fully complied with the foregoing obligation. I agree that I will not copy, delete, or alter any information contained upon my Company computer or other Group Company equipment before I return it to Company. I further agree that any property situated on Group Company’s premises and owned by Group Company is subject to inspection by Group Company personnel at any time with or without notice. Prior to leaving, I will cooperate with Company in attending an exit interview and completing and signing Company’s termination statement and related documents. I agree and acknowledge that, upon termination of my internship, any access by me of any computer, mobile phone or personal digital assistant of Company or Group Company constitutes access without authorization and exceeds authorization by Company. 6. NOTIFICATION OF NEW EMPLOYER. Upon cessation of my internship with the Company, I hereby consent to and authorize the notification of my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, by Company’s providing a copy of this Agreement or otherwise. 7. GENERAL PROVISIONS. 7.1 Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed, controlled, interpreted, and defined by and under the laws of India, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state. I hereby expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of Bengaluru for any lawsuit filed there against me by Company arising from or related to this Agreement. 7.2 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. 7.3 Survival. This Agreement shall survive the termination of my internship and the assignment of this Agreement by Company to any successor-in-interest or other assignee and be binding upon my heirs and legal representatives. 7.4 Internship. I agree and understand that nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right with respect to continuation of my internship with Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with my right or Company’s right to terminate my internship at any time, with or without cause and with or without advance notice. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall imply any employment relationship with NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company. 7.5 Notices. Each party must deliver all notices or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement in writing to the other party at the address listed on the signature page, by courier, by certified or registered mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized express mail service. Notice will be effective upon receipt or refusal of delivery. If delivered by certified or registered mail, any such notice will be considered to have been given five (5) business days after it was mailed, as evidenced by the postmark. If delivered by courier or express mail service, any such notice shall be considered to have been given on the delivery date reflected by the courier or express mail service receipt. Each party may change its address for receipt of notice by giving notice of such change to the other party. 7.6 Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that, because I will have access to the Confidential Information of Group Company, any breach of this Agreement by me would cause irreparable injury to Group Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle Group Company to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity. 7.7 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. 7.8 Export.

I agree that I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation to any destination requiring an export license or other approval under the EAR or other legislation without first obtaining such export license or approval and Company’s permission. I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation, directly or indirectly, either to any end user who I know or have reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. My obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. I understand and agree that to the extent my duties and responsibilities for Company require me to be exposed to or to work with Company technology that is restricted by the EAR or other government restrictions, my internship with Company is contingent upon satisfactory proof that I have the legal right to have access to this technology. This may require proof of U.S. citizenship, permanent residence status, or other approved immigration status and/or Company’s ability to obtain an appropriate export license or other government approval. I further understand and agree that Company is not obligated to apply for any such government license or approval and cannot guarantee that the United States Government or any other regulatory body will provide such license or approval in the event Company applies for it. 7.9 Entire Agreement. The obligations pursuant to sections of this Agreement titled “Confidentiality” and “Inventions” shall apply to any time during which I may in the future be employed or engaged as an employee or independent contractor by Company or Group Company if no other agreement governs nondisclosure and assignment of inventions during such period. In such case (but at all times subject to Section 7.4), references in this Agreement and my internship with the Company shall also refer to such internship or engagement by such Group Company and “Company” shall also refer to such Group Company or hiring entity. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior communications between us with respect to such matters. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, or any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by me and a duly authorized representative of Company. Any subsequent change or changes in my training, duties, or stipend will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement. 7.10 Compliance with Company Policies. I understand that Company will provide me with full access to the Company’s policies and procedures during the time that I am interning with Company (the “Company Policies”). I agree to access, read, and comply with the terms and conditions of the Company Policies, and with any modifications that are made thereto from time to time. This Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of my internship with Company.

Hence some of the candidates can the internship as this may affect their vertical allocation when they join as full time employees. This training is being planned keeping in mind that these candidates are trained before hand and can take up the work quickly once they join as FTEs.

During the term of my internship with Company and thereafter, I will hold Third Party Information in strict confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than Group Company personnel who need to know such information in connection with their work for Group Company) or use, except in connection with my training with the Company, such Third Party Information, unless expressly authorized by an officer of NVIDIA Corporation in writing prior to any such disclosure or use. 1.4 No Improper Use of Information of Prior Employers and Others. I represent that my internship with the Company does not and will not breach any agreement with any former employer, including any noncompete agreement or any agreement to keep in confidence information acquired by me in confidence or trust prior to my internship with the Company. I represent that I am under no obligations or commitments, whether contractual or otherwise, that are inconsistent with my obligations under this agreement. I further represent that I have not entered into, and will not enter into, any agreement, either written or oral, in conflict herewith and that I am not on a leave of absence or similar arrangement from a different employer. During or in connection with my internship with the Company, I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information, trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property of any former employer or other third party who has any right, title or interest in such information or intellectual property or to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality.

The term “Intellectual Property Rights” means all trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, mask work rights, patents and other intellectual property rights recognized by the laws of any jurisdiction or country. 2.2 Prior Inventions. I agree that I will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, Prior Inventions (defined below) in any NVIDIA Inventions (defined below) without NVIDIA Corporation’s prior written consent. In addition, I agree that I will not incorporate into any Group Company software or otherwise deliver to Group Company any software code licensed under the GNU GPL or LGPL or any other license that, by its terms, requires or conditions the use or distribution of such code on the disclosure, licensing, or distribution of any source code owned or licensed by Group Company, except in accordance with Group Company’s policies. I have disclosed on Exhibit A a complete list of all Inventions that I have, or I have caused to be, alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my internship with the Company, in which I have an ownership interest or which I have a license to use, and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (collectively referred to as “Prior Inventions”). If no Prior Inventions are listed in Exhibit A, I warrant that there are no Prior Inventions. If, in the course of my internship with the Company, I incorporate a Prior Invention into a Group Company product, process, machine or other work, I hereby grant Group Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully-paid and royalty-free, irrevocable and worldwide license, with rights to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to reproduce, make derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display in any form or medium, whether now known or later developed, make, have made, use, sell, import, offer for sale, and exercise any and all present or future rights in, such Prior Invention. 2.3 Assignment of NVIDIA Inventions. Subject to the section entitled “Government or Third Party” below, I hereby irrevocably and perpetually assign and agree to assign (on a worldwide, and royalty free basis) in the future (when any such Inventions or Intellectual Property Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to NVIDIA Corporation all of my right, title, and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Intellectual Property Rights with respect thereto) made, conceived, reduced to practice, or learned by me, either alone or with others, during the period of my internship with the Company, except for Excluded Inventions. “Excluded Inventions” are only those Inventions that meet all of the following criteria: Inventions that (a) I develop entirely on my own time (without using any Group Company equipment, supplies, facilities, Confidential Information or trade secret information), (b) do not result from any work performed by me for the Company or the Group Company, and (c) do not relate to Group Company’s business or any actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of Group Company (as determined and approved by a member of NVIDIA Corporation’s Legal Department and my manager (or business unit Vice President, if required by Group Company’s policies)). To the extent such assignment of Inventions under this section cannot be made to NVIDIA Corporation, I agree such assignment shall be to the Company. Inventions assigned to NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company pursuant to this section or to a third party as directed by NVIDIA Corporation pursuant to the section below titled “Government or Third Party” or otherwise to any Group Company under applicable law are referred to in this Agreement as “NVIDIA Inventions.” Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19(4) and 30A of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, such assignment or license (as the case may be) in so far as it relates to copyrightable material shall not lapse nor the rights transferred therein revert to me, even if the Company does not exercise the rights under the assignment or license (as the case may be) within a period of one year from the date of assignment. I further acknowledge and agree that I shall waive any right to and shall not raise any objection or claims to the Copyright Board with respect to the assignment, pursuant to Section 19A of the Copyright Act, 1957. 2.4 Obligation to Keep NVIDIA Corporation Informed. In addition to my other obligations hereunder, during the period of my internship with the Company, I will promptly disclose to NVIDIA Corporation fully and in writing all patent applications filed by me or on my behalf. In order for NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether any invention was made during my internship with Company and/or is based upon Group Company’s Confidential Information, I agree that during the two (2) year period after the termination of my internship by Company for any reason, I will promptly: (i) notify NVIDIA Corporation that any one or more patent applications have been filed by me or on my behalf, either alone or with others; and (ii) provide NVIDIA Corporation with a list of the names of the coapplicants, if any, and a description of the subject matter of the patent application that is sufficiently detailed to reasonably allow NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether it relates to Group Company’s Confidential Information, its business, or its actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development. 2.5 Government or Third Party. I also agree that as directed by NVIDIA Corporation, I will assign all of my right, title, and interest in and to any particular NVIDIA Invention to a third party, including without limitation the United States. 2.6 Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights and Assistance. During the period of my internship and thereafter, I will assist NVIDIA Corporation in every proper way to obtain and enforce United States and foreign Intellectual Property Rights relating to NVIDIA Inventions in all countries. In the event NVIDIA Corporation is unable to secure my signature on any document needed in connection with such purposes, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint NVIDIA Corporation and its duly authorized officers and agents, including in particular the GC, as my agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act on my behalf to execute and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further such purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. 3.

I will return those records to Company at the termination of my internship whether voluntary, or with or without cause by Company, or immediately upon request by Company. 4. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES. I agree that: (a) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not engage in any employment, consulting, advisory, business or similar activity (collectively, the “Outside Activities”) without the written approval (the “Approval”) of my immediate supervisor and the Vice President, Corporate Affairs of NVIDIA Corporation, as required under NVIDIA’s Conflict of Interest Guidelines; and (b) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not compete with Group Company, nor assist any person or entity in competing with Group Company, in preparing to compete with Group Company or in hiring any employees or consultants of Group Company. I have disclosed on Exhibit B a complete list of all Outside Activities that I am seeking Approval to participate in during my internship with Company. If no Outside Activities are listed in Exhibit B, I warrant that there are no Outside Activities. Examples of Outside Activities include, but are not limited to: engaging in self-employment; providing consulting or advisory services to any other company or business (unless on behalf of Group Company); or acting as a board member or officer of any entity. 5. RETURN OF GROUP COMPANY PROPERTY. Immediately upon termination of my internship or upon Company’s request at any other time, I will deliver to Company all of Group Company’s property, equipment, credit cards, phone cards, computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, building cards, keys and documents (hard-copy or electronic copies), together with all copies thereof, and any other material containing or disclosing any Inventions, Third Party Information or Confidential Information of Group Company and certify in writing that I have fully complied with the foregoing obligation.

I further agree that any property situated on Group Company’s premises and owned by Group Company is subject to inspection by Group Company personnel at any time with or without notice. Prior to leaving, I will cooperate with Company in attending an exit interview and completing and signing Company’s termination statement and related documents. I agree and acknowledge that, upon termination of my internship, any access by me of any computer, mobile phone or personal digital assistant of Company or Group Company constitutes access without authorization and exceeds authorization by Company. 6. NOTIFICATION OF NEW EMPLOYER. Upon cessation of my internship with the Company, I hereby consent to and authorize the notification of my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, by Company’s providing a copy of this Agreement or otherwise. 7. GENERAL PROVISIONS. 7.1 Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed, controlled, interpreted, and defined by and under the laws of India, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state. I hereby expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of Bengaluru for any lawsuit filed there against me by Company arising from or related to this Agreement. 7.2 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. 7.3 Survival. This Agreement shall survive the termination of my internship and the assignment of this Agreement by Company to any successor-in-interest or other assignee and be binding upon my heirs and legal representatives. 7.4 Internship.

Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall imply any employment relationship with NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company. 7.5 Notices. Each party must deliver all notices or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement in writing to the other party at the address listed on the signature page, by courier, by certified or registered mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized express mail service.

Each party may change its address for receipt of notice by giving notice of such change to the other party. 7.6 Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that, because I will have access to the Confidential Information of Group Company, any breach of this Agreement by me would cause irreparable injury to Group Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle Group Company to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity. 7.7 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. 7.8 Export.

I agree that I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation to any destination requiring an export license or other approval under the EAR or other legislation without first obtaining such export license or approval and Company’s permission. I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation, directly or indirectly, either to any end user who I know or have reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. My obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. I understand and agree that to the extent my duties and responsibilities for Company require me to be exposed to or to work with Company technology that is restricted by the EAR or other government restrictions, my internship with Company is contingent upon satisfactory proof that I have the legal right to have access to this technology. This may require proof of U.S. citizenship, permanent residence status, or other approved immigration status and/or Company’s ability to obtain an appropriate export license or other government approval. I further understand and agree that Company is not obligated to apply for any such government license or approval and cannot guarantee that the United States Government or any other regulatory body will provide such license or approval in the event Company applies for it. 7.9 Entire Agreement. The obligations pursuant to sections of this Agreement titled “Confidentiality” and “Inventions” shall apply to any time during which I may in the future be employed or engaged as an employee or independent contractor by Company or Group Company if no other agreement governs nondisclosure and assignment of inventions during such period. In such case (but at all times subject to Section 7.4), references in this Agreement and my internship with the Company shall also refer to such internship or engagement by such Group Company and “Company” shall also refer to such Group Company or hiring entity. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior communications between us with respect to such matters. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, or any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by me and a duly authorized representative of Company. Any subsequent change or changes in my training, duties, or stipend will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement. 7.10 Compliance with Company Policies. I understand that Company will provide me with full access to the Company’s policies and procedures during the time that I am interning with Company (the “Company Policies”).

The purpose of this internship is to provide you with guidance and experience that will be helpful in your future career. In furtherance of this, you will be asked to assist with various assignments and tasks and you should use your best efforts in executing such projects. During the tenure of your internship, you should work closely with your assigned project lead who will guide you and review your assignments to ensure that the internship is an enriching experience for you. As a condition of your internship with NVIDIA, you will be required to read and comply with all applicable Company policies, including but not limited to the NVIDIA Code of Conduct (which applies to all Company interns and is available at www.nvidia.com/ir), which may be amended from time to time. Failure to comply with any of the Company policies may lead to disciplinary action, including and up to termination of your internship. By signing this Agreement, you agree to read and abide by the Code of Conduct and applicable policies, including subsequent updates. You acknowledge and agree that you are an intern, and not an \"employee\" or a \"workman\" for purposes of any employment statute, rule or regulation under applicable law and the Company provides no assurance or guarantee that you will be employed by NVIDIA upon completion of your internship. Place and Days of Work During your internship, you will be based at NVIDIA's offices located in India, Bengaluru. Your internship schedule will be set by your project lead in accordance with applicable law. However, you may be asked to travel to other places (including the Company’s other offices) in India if required by the Company for the proper and efficient performance of your tasks as an intern. In the event that you are asked to travel outside of India, Bengaluru , all pre-approved expenses incurred during such travel shall be reimbursed in accordance with NVIDIA's policies. Stipend and Certificate As an intern, you will be paid a stipend of INR 75,000 per month, subject to applicable deductions and required statutory withholdings in accordance with NVIDIA’s standard payroll schedule and applicable law. As an intern, you may be eligible to participate in NVIDIA-sponsored benefits, such as NVIDIA Gear Store credits and cafeteria and transportation services, to the extent you meet the eligibility requirements of each such benefit plan. NVIDIA reserves the right to modify, change, or discontinue all or part of these benefits at any time at its sole discretion. Upon your successful completion of the internship program, you will be provided an internship certificate by NVIDIA. Term of the Internship Your internship program shall be for a maximum term of 5 months, starting on January 29, 2024 and ending automatically on July 5, 2024, without notice being required (the “End Date”).

Termination During your internship and prior to the End Date, NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement by providing one week's written notice (or stipend in lieu thereof). NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement at any time for just cause or misconduct without providing you with notice or stipend in lieu. Misconduct by you includes, but is not limited to: fraudulent, dishonest or undisciplined conduct, or breach of integrity, or embezzlement, or misappropriation or misuse of NVIDIA’s property, or insubordination or failure to comply with the directions given to you by persons so authorized, or your insolvency or conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, or breach of any terms of this Agreement or other Company policies that may be applicable to you or directions of the Company, or irregularity in attendance, or your unauthorized absence from the place of work for more than seven (7) consecutive working days. Limited Authority You agree that you will not (i) enter into any commitments or dealings on behalf of NVIDIA; (ii) be a party to any alteration of any principle or policy of NVIDIA; or (iii) exceed any authority or direction that may be vested in you without prior written approval by NVIDIA or those in authority over you at NVIDIA. Any violation of the above may lead to disciplinary action, which may include termination of your internship, subject to applicable law. Confidentiality As a condition of your internship with NVIDIA you will be required to read and sign the enclosed Confidentiality and Inventions Assignment Agreement (“CIAA”) attached hereto as Exhibit A. In addition to your compliance with the terms under the CIAA, you shall also keep the terms and conditions of your internship strictly confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, any disclosure of confidential terms and conditions of your internship will constitute a breach of this Agreement and may result in termination of your internship. Data Privacy and Monitoring In the context of your internship it is necessary for NVIDIA to collect, use, and store certain personal and sensitive personal information about you for administrative, management, compliance, and other purposes. By signing this Agreement, you consent to the Company collecting, processing, transferring and handling data, including personal and sensitive personal data, relating to you for legal, personnel, administrative and management purposes.

NVIDIA also reserves the right to monitor your activities using various security measures including but not limited to closed circuit television systems. These may be installed on the Company's premises overtly or covertly to ensure that you do not participate or propagate any activities which are or could be prejudicial to Group Company's business interests or which could bring it into disrepute. To the extent that you may have access to the personal data of others (within or outside the Group Company) in the course of your internship with NVIDIA, you also agree that you will strictly comply with all applicable data protection laws, regulations and guidelines and any policies issued by NVIDIA or the Group Company from time to time relating to data protection and privacy, and you acknowledge that the breach of any such rules is likely to be regarded as gross misconduct.

For the loss of any property of NVIDIA in your possession, NVIDIA will have a right to assess the value of the loss on its own basis and recover the damages as it deems proper in the event of your failure to account for such material or property to its satisfaction. On expiry or earlier termination of this Agreement, you shall immediately provide all papers, documents and other property of NVIDIA and the Group Company that may be in your possession, custody, control or power, including but not limited to any phones or computers provided by NVIDIA during your internship.

I further represent that I have not entered into, and will not enter into, any agreement, either written or oral, in conflict herewith and that I am not on a leave of absence or similar arrangement from a different employer. During or in connection with my internship with the Company, I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information, trade secrets or other proprietary information or intellectual property of any former employer or other third party who has any right, title or interest in such information or intellectual property or to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality.

I have disclosed on Exhibit A a complete list of all Inventions that I have, or I have caused to be, alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my internship with the Company, in which I have an ownership interest or which I have a license to use, and that I wish to have excluded from the scope of this Agreement (collectively referred to as “Prior Inventions”). If no Prior Inventions are listed in Exhibit A, I warrant that there are no Prior Inventions. If, in the course of my internship with the Company, I incorporate a Prior Invention into a Group Company product, process, machine or other work, I hereby grant Group Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully-paid and royalty-free, irrevocable and worldwide license, with rights to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to reproduce, make derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display in any form or medium, whether now known or later developed, make, have made, use, sell, import, offer for sale, and exercise any and all present or future rights in, such Prior Invention. 2.3 Assignment of NVIDIA Inventions. Subject to the section entitled “Government or Third Party” below, I hereby irrevocably and perpetually assign and agree to assign (on a worldwide, and royalty free basis) in the future (when any such Inventions or Intellectual Property Rights are first reduced to practice or first fixed in a tangible medium, as applicable) to NVIDIA Corporation all of my right, title, and interest in and to any and all Inventions (and all Intellectual Property Rights with respect thereto) made, conceived, reduced to practice, or learned by me, either alone or with others, during the period of my internship with the Company, except for Excluded Inventions. “Excluded Inventions” are only those Inventions that meet all of the following criteria: Inventions that (a) I develop entirely on my own time (without using any Group Company equipment, supplies, facilities, Confidential Information or trade secret information), (b) do not result from any work performed by me for the Company or the Group Company, and (c) do not relate to Group Company’s business or any actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of Group Company (as determined and approved by a member of NVIDIA Corporation’s Legal Department and my manager (or business unit Vice President, if required by Group Company’s policies)). To the extent such assignment of Inventions under this section cannot be made to NVIDIA Corporation, I agree such assignment shall be to the Company. Inventions assigned to NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company pursuant to this section or to a third party as directed by NVIDIA Corporation pursuant to the section below titled “Government or Third Party” or otherwise to any Group Company under applicable law are referred to in this Agreement as “NVIDIA Inventions.” Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19(4) and 30A of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, such assignment or license (as the case may be) in so far as it relates to copyrightable material shall not lapse nor the rights transferred therein revert to me, even if the Company does not exercise the rights under the assignment or license (as the case may be) within a period of one year from the date of assignment. I further acknowledge and agree that I shall waive any right to and shall not raise any objection or claims to the Copyright Board with respect to the assignment, pursuant to Section 19A of the Copyright Act, 1957. 2.4 Obligation to Keep NVIDIA Corporation Informed. In addition to my other obligations hereunder, during the period of my internship with the Company, I will promptly disclose to NVIDIA Corporation fully and in writing all patent applications filed by me or on my behalf. In order for NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether any invention was made during my internship with Company and/or is based upon Group Company’s Confidential Information, I agree that during the two (2) year period after the termination of my internship by Company for any reason, I will promptly: (i) notify NVIDIA Corporation that any one or more patent applications have been filed by me or on my behalf, either alone or with others; and (ii) provide NVIDIA Corporation with a list of the names of the coapplicants, if any, and a description of the subject matter of the patent application that is sufficiently detailed to reasonably allow NVIDIA Corporation to determine whether it relates to Group Company’s Confidential Information, its business, or its actual or demonstrably anticipated research and development. 2.5 Government or Third Party. I also agree that as directed by NVIDIA Corporation, I will assign all of my right, title, and interest in and to any particular NVIDIA Invention to a third party, including without limitation the United States. 2.6 Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights and Assistance. During the period of my internship and thereafter, I will assist NVIDIA Corporation in every proper way to obtain and enforce United States and foreign Intellectual Property Rights relating to NVIDIA Inventions in all countries. In the event NVIDIA Corporation is unable to secure my signature on any document needed in connection with such purposes, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint NVIDIA Corporation and its duly authorized officers and agents, including in particular the GC, as my agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act on my behalf to execute and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further such purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me. 3. RECORDS. I agree to keep and maintain, and under no circumstances to discard or destroy, adequate and current records (in the form of note books, notes, sketches, drawings and in any other form that is required by Company) of all Inventions made by me during the period of my internship with Company, which records shall be available to, and remain the sole property of, Company at all times. I will return those records to Company at the termination of my internship whether voluntary, or with or without cause by Company, or immediately upon request by Company. 4. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES. I agree that: (a) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not engage in any employment, consulting, advisory, business or similar activity (collectively, the “Outside Activities”) without the written approval (the “Approval”) of my immediate supervisor and the Vice President, Corporate Affairs of NVIDIA Corporation, as required under NVIDIA’s Conflict of Interest Guidelines; and (b) during the term of my internship with Company, I will not compete with Group Company, nor assist any person or entity in competing with Group Company, in preparing to compete with Group Company or in hiring any employees or consultants of Group Company. I have disclosed on Exhibit B a complete list of all Outside Activities that I am seeking Approval to participate in during my internship with Company. If no Outside Activities are listed in Exhibit B, I warrant that there are no Outside Activities. Examples of Outside Activities include, but are not limited to: engaging in self-employment; providing consulting or advisory services to any other company or business (unless on behalf of Group Company); or acting as a board member or officer of any entity. 5. RETURN OF GROUP COMPANY PROPERTY. Immediately upon termination of my internship or upon Company’s request at any other time, I will deliver to Company all of Group Company’s property, equipment, credit cards, phone cards, computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, building cards, keys and documents (hard-copy or electronic copies), together with all copies thereof, and any other material containing or disclosing any Inventions, Third Party Information or Confidential Information of Group Company and certify in writing that I have fully complied with the foregoing obligation. I agree that I will not copy, delete, or alter any information contained upon my Company computer or other Group Company equipment before I return it to Company. I further agree that any property situated on Group Company’s premises and owned by Group Company is subject to inspection by Group Company personnel at any time with or without notice. Prior to leaving, I will cooperate with Company in attending an exit interview and completing and signing Company’s termination statement and related documents. I agree and acknowledge that, upon termination of my internship, any access by me of any computer, mobile phone or personal digital assistant of Company or Group Company constitutes access without authorization and exceeds authorization by Company. 6. NOTIFICATION OF NEW EMPLOYER. Upon cessation of my internship with the Company, I hereby consent to and authorize the notification of my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, by Company’s providing a copy of this Agreement or otherwise. 7. GENERAL PROVISIONS. 7.1 Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed, controlled, interpreted, and defined by and under the laws of India, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state. I hereby expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of Bengaluru for any lawsuit filed there against me by Company arising from or related to this Agreement. 7.2 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. 7.3 Survival. This Agreement shall survive the termination of my internship and the assignment of this Agreement by Company to any successor-in-interest or other assignee and be binding upon my heirs and legal representatives. 7.4 Internship. I agree and understand that nothing in this Agreement shall confer any right with respect to continuation of my internship with Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with my right or Company’s right to terminate my internship at any time, with or without cause and with or without advance notice. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall imply any employment relationship with NVIDIA Corporation or any Group Company. 7.5 Notices. Each party must deliver all notices or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement in writing to the other party at the address listed on the signature page, by courier, by certified or registered mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized express mail service. Notice will be effective upon receipt or refusal of delivery. If delivered by certified or registered mail, any such notice will be considered to have been given five (5) business days after it was mailed, as evidenced by the postmark. If delivered by courier or express mail service, any such notice shall be considered to have been given on the delivery date reflected by the courier or express mail service receipt. Each party may change its address for receipt of notice by giving notice of such change to the other party. 7.6 Injunctive Relief. I acknowledge that, because I will have access to the Confidential Information of Group Company, any breach of this Agreement by me would cause irreparable injury to Group Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle Group Company to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity. 7.7 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. 7.8 Export. I hereby acknowledge that Group Company’s products, technology and related documentation under this Agreement may be restricted subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) or other applicable legislation. I agree that I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation to any destination requiring an export license or other approval under the EAR or other legislation without first obtaining such export license or approval and Company’s permission. I will not export or reexport the products, technology and related documentation, directly or indirectly, either to any end user who I know or have reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. My obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. I understand and agree that to the extent my duties and responsibilities for Company require me to be exposed to or to work with Company technology that is restricted by the EAR or other government restrictions, my internship with Company is contingent upon satisfactory proof that I have the legal right to have access to this technology. This may require proof of U.S. citizenship, permanent residence status, or other approved immigration status and/or Company’s ability to obtain an appropriate export license or other government approval. I further understand and agree that Company is not obligated to apply for any such government license or approval and cannot guarantee that the United States Government or any other regulatory body will provide such license or approval in the event Company applies for it. 7.9 Entire Agreement. The obligations pursuant to sections of this Agreement titled “Confidentiality” and “Inventions” shall apply to any time during which I may in the future be employed or engaged as an employee or independent contractor by Company or Group Company if no other agreement governs nondisclosure and assignment of inventions during such period. In such case (but at all times subject to Section 7.4), references in this Agreement and my internship with the Company shall also refer to such internship or engagement by such Group Company and “Company” shall also refer to such Group Company or hiring entity. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior communications between us with respect to such matters. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, or any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by me and a duly authorized representative of Company. Any subsequent change or changes in my training, duties, or stipend will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement. 7.10 Compliance with Company Policies. I understand that Company will provide me with full access to the Company’s policies and procedures during the time that I am interning with Company (the “Company Policies”). I agree to access, read, and comply with the terms and conditions of the Company Policies, and with any modifications that are made thereto from time to time. This Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of my internship with Company. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS MY RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS I MAKE DURING MY INTERNSHIP, AND RESTRICTS MY RIGHT TO DISCLOSE OR USE COMPANY'S CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION DURING OR SUBSEQUENT TO MY INTERNSHIP. I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, HAVING BEEN GIVEN THE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN MY OWN LEGAL COUNSEL TO REVIEW AND ADVISE ME ON THIS DOCUMENT.
